      <description>2016 California Contributors plots
We would like make a plot that shows the top ten cities in highest amounts raised in political contributions in California during the 2016 US Presidential election.Also, we would like to create the same plot for the top 10 candidates.
To get this plot, we shall join two dataframes; one contains all contributions, and another can translate zipcodes to cities.
CA_contributors_2016 &amp;lt;- vroom::vroom(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;CA_contributors_2016.csv&amp;quot;))zip_code_database &amp;lt;- vroom::vroom(here::here(&amp;quot;data&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;zip_code_database.</description>

      <description>Yield Curve inversion: When has it happened and what does it imply?Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a inverted yield curve is can be found here.
In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession. One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and use the attached parable on yield curve inversions.</description>
