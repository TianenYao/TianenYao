<h2>My career development</h2>
<p>I have been doing several interns in different Chinese security companies, including <em>GUOTAI JUNAN SECURITIES, HUAAN SECURITIES and HUATAI SECURITIES</em>. Further details can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianen-yao/">LinkedIn Page</a>. My ambition is to help maintain the momentum of China economy by providing high-quality financing service for Chinese enterprises, so my primary goal for the time being is to find a position in the <strong>investment banking sector</strong> in Asia region after graduation. I’m also open to pursuing opportunities in other sectors and I’m eager to discuss with the LBS career advisors to deeply learn about the working experience in different financial sectors, further clarify my career goals and improve my career skills.</p>

<h2>My expectation of the coming LBS year</h2>
<p>I am eager to discover more cutting-edge knowledge in various aspects of finance and prepare myself with solid academic background as well as practical real-world experience before formally entering in to the fiercely competitive financial industry, and the <strong>MFA core courses</strong> can definitely offer me the key financial skills in all financial pillars. I am eager to gain insights of the latest research and trends in the finance industry from the exceptional faculty in LBS.</p>
<p>Great opportunities to have <strong>valuable career exposure</strong> are another key attraction of the MFA. I am looking forward to examining my practical skills in London Business Challenge week and connecting with world-class global financial institutions throughout my MFA experience. I will endeavor to efficiently use the comprehensive career resources offered by the LBS Career Centre to search for job opportunities in various finance sectors.</p>
<p>The <strong>diversified global community</strong> at LBS is another motivation to apply for the MFA. I hope to study and collaborate with the best and the brightest fellows in my graduate studies, learning perspectives from different cultural background and thriving together to discover the cutting-edge finance knowledge and fight for our ideal recruitment.</p>
